fixes:
  - The module-instances command now returns a paginated
    list of instances.  A --count_only flag was added to the
    command to return a summary of the applied instances
    based on the MD5 of the module (this is most useful
    for live_update modules, to see which ones haven't been
    updated). Bug 1554900
