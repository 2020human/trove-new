ONE:

Looks like the on-behalf-of functionality in python novaclient is borked in association w/ keystone
*There are 2 different calls to keystone to get token info, and they return different hash's
*The service catalog borks out if 'access' is not the main key, but in the 2nd case 'token' is the main key.

Modified Files
* novaclient/service_catalog.py

Until this is fixed you need to mod python-novaclient after it gets downloaded via devstack

TWO:

funkyness w/ the extensions. the extensions url itself wont load. Seems to have to do with authorization & tenants.
 * mitigated in reddwarf/common/extensions.py, see for more information
