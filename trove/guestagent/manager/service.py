    """
    Answers the question "what is the status of the DB application on
    this box?" The answer can be that the application is not installed, or
    the state of the application is determined by calling a series of
    commands.

    This class also handles saving and load the status of the DB application
    in the database.
    The status is updated whenever the update() method is called, except
    if the state is changed to building or restart mode using the
     "begin_install" and "begin_restart" methods.
    The building mode persists in the database while restarting mode does
    not (so if there is a Python Pete crash update() will set the status to
    show a failure).
    These modes are exited and functionality to update() returns when
    end_install_or_restart() is called, at which point the status again
    reflects the actual status of the DB app.

    This is a base class, subclasses must implement real logic for
    determining current status of DB in _get_actual_db_status()
